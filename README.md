# Comments App

##### Hello, everyone!

This is my first web app using React Js and I'm learning a lot by doing it. I went through all that basics stuff like 'How to criate a React component', 'How to work with forms', 'How to use State'. It has been challenging, but I'll keep working on it.

The app itself uses the basics of React JS and I chose to apply Tailwind CSS framework which allows us to apply styles in our components easier and faster.
